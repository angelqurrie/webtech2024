  <h1>Car's Outside</h1>
  <h3>Song by James Arthur</h3>
  <pre>
    I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
    I'm sayin', "See you again, " so many times, it's becoming my tagline
    But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
    Than try to catch this flight
    So many things I'd rather say
    But for now, it's goodbye 

    You say I'm always leavin'
    You, when you're sleepin' alone
    But the, the car's outside
    But I don't wanna go tonight

    I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
    Unless you pack your bags
    You're comin' with me
    I'm tired of lovin' from afar
    And never being where you are
    Close the windows, lock the doors
    Don't wanna leave you anymore

    Oh-oh, ah

    I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
    It's an unfamiliar feelin' but I know it so well
    Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
    Than this mobile in my hand
    But I guess it'll do, 'cause for you
    I would run up my phone bill

    You say I'm always leavin'
    You, when you need me the most
    But the, the car's outside
    But I don't wanna go tonight

    I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
    Unless you pack your bags
    You're comin' with me
    I'm tired of lovin' from afar
    And never being where you are
    Close the windows, lock the doors
    Don't wanna leave you anymore

    Ooh-ooh, ah
    Ooh-ooh, ah
    Ooh-ooh, ah
    Don't wanna leave you anymore

    Oh, darling, all of the city lights
    Never shine as bright as your eyes
    I would trade them all for a minute more
    But the car's outside
    And he's called me twice
    But he's gonna have to wait tonight

    I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee
    Unless you pack your bags
    You're comin' with me
    I'm tired of lovin' from afar
    And never being where you are
    Close the windows, lock the doors
    Don't wanna leave you anymore

    Ooh-ooh, ah
    Ooh-ooh, ah
    Ooh-ooh, ah
    No, I don't wanna leave you anymore

    I don't wanna leave you
    (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
    (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you
    Don't wanna leave you anymore</pre>
